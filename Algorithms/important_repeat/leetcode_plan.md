# Ultimate Study Guide for Mastering LeetCode & FAANG/MAANG Interviews

## Step-by-Step Plan for Training & Solving LeetCode Problems

### **1. Build the Right Mindset**
- **Neuroscience-backed learning:** Leverage **active recall** and **spaced repetition** to enhance memory retention (per research by Hermann Ebbinghaus on the forgetting curve).
- **Focus on problem-solving patterns**, not just individual problems.
- **Growth mindset:** Embrace failures as learning opportunities (Carol Dweck's research).
- **Deliberate practice:** Solve problems at increasing difficulty levels and revisit old problems regularly.
- **Consistency is key**â€”solve 1â€“3 problems daily to reinforce learning.

## **2. Structured Study Plan for LeetCode**

| Week | Focus Area | Topics |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1â€“2  | Arrays & Strings | Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Hashing |
| 3â€“4  | Recursion & Backtracking | DFS, Permutations, Combinations |
| 5â€“6  | Dynamic Programming (DP) | Memoization, Tabulation, Common DP Problems |
| 7â€“8  | Trees & Graphs | BFS, DFS, Topological Sort, Dijkstra's Algorithm |
| 9â€“10 | Advanced Topics | Bit Manipulation, Heap, Tries, Segment Trees |
| 11+  | Mock Interviews | Mixed problems, system design discussions |

## **3. Problem-Solving Framework for LeetCode**
1. **Understand the problem:**
    - Read the prompt carefully.
    - Identify input/output constraints.
    - Ask clarifying questions (What if input is empty? Are duplicates allowed?).

2. **Plan the solution:**
    - Identify the best approach (**Brute force â†’ Optimized solution**).
    - Consider the best **data structures** to use.
    - Sketch a high-level plan before coding.

3. **Analyze complexity:**
    - Evaluate **time** and **space complexity** (Big-O notation).
    - Look for possible optimizations (e.g., replacing nested loops with hash maps).

4. **Write clean & efficient code:**
    - Follow **Golang best practices** (Uber Go Style Guide, idiomatic Go).
    - Keep functions modular and readable.
    - Optimize with proper **caching, memoization, and space-efficient techniques**.

5. **Test and debug:**
    - Start with simple cases.
    - Include **edge cases** (empty input, max/min values, duplicates).
    - Debug using **print statements** or **Go debugger**.

## **4. Best Practices for Studying & Retaining Information**
- **Spaced repetition (Anki, LeetCode bookmarks)**â€”Repeat problems at intervals to strengthen memory.
- **Active recall**â€”Before reviewing solutions, try to solve again from memory.
- **Mock interviews**â€”Simulate real interview conditions (LeetCode, Pramp, interviewing.io).
- **Deep work sessions**â€”Use **Pomodoro (50m focus, 10m break)** for optimal cognitive performance.
- **Sleep & exercise**â€”Adequate sleep enhances problem-solving skills (per Matthew Walkerâ€™s sleep research).
- **Explain solutions aloud**â€”Teach a peer or write a blog post about solutions (Feynman Technique).

## **5. Mastering FAANG/MAANG Interview Strategy**

### **Behavioral Interview Preparation**
- Use **STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result)** format for answering behavioral questions.
- Prepare for common topics: leadership, conflict resolution, handling failure.
- Study **company values** (Google's "Googleyness," Amazon's "Leadership Principles").

### **Time Management in Interviews**
- Spend **5â€“10 min** understanding and planning.
- Spend **20â€“25 min** coding.
- Spend **5 min** testing & explaining.
