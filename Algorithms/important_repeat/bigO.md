## **2. Understanding Time Complexity**
### **Rules of Thumb**
1. **Ignore constants and low-order terms**: \( O(2n) \) simplifies to \( O(n) \).
2. **Focus on dominant operations**: Nested loops dominate over single loops.
3. **Common patterns**:
    - Iterating once: **O(n)**
    - Nested loops: **O(n¬≤)**
    - Halving input: **O(log n)**
    - Recursion with branching: **O(2‚Åø)**

### **Common Time Complexities**
| Complexity | Name | Example |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| O(1) | Constant | Accessing an array element |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary search |
| O(n) | Linear | Iterating through an array |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Merge Sort |
| O(n¬≤) | Quadratic | Bubble Sort |
| O(2‚Åø) | Exponential | Fibonacci (naive recursion) |
| O(n!) | Factorial | Traveling Salesman (brute-force) |

## **3. Analyzing Loops & Recursion**
### **Iterative Complexity Analysis**
#### **Example 1: Single Loop (O(n))**
```go
func printItems(n int) {
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
```
‚úÖ Loop runs \( n \) times ‚Üí **O(n)**.

#### **Example 2: Nested Loops (O(n¬≤))**
```go
func printPairs(arr []int) {
    for i := 0; i < len(arr); i++ {
        for j := 0; j < len(arr); j++ {
            fmt.Println(arr[i], arr[j])
        }
    }
}
```
‚úÖ Each loop runs \( n \) times ‚Üí **O(n¬≤)**.

### **Recursive Complexity Analysis**
#### **Example 3: Logarithmic Complexity (O(log n))**
- Sure, logarithmic time complexity is one of the fundamental concepts in computer science related to the performance of algorithms, and it is denoted as O(log(N)).

Logarithmic Function:
A logarithm is the inverse function of exponentiation. The logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simpler terms, if we have an equation:

b^x = N
Then the logarithm of N to the base b is x:

log_b(N) = x
Logarithmic Time Complexity:
When we say an algorithm has a logarithmic time complexity, we mean that the time it takes to complete its execution is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the input. As the input size (N) grows, the number of steps (or operations) the algorithm takes grows logarithmically.

An important property of logarithms is that they grow very slowly. Doubling the size of the input doesn't double the amount of work; it just adds a constant amount of extra work. This makes O(log(N)) algorithms very efficient for large N.

Examples and Intuition:
Binary Search: Consider a sorted array of numbers. You want to find if a particular number is in the array. A binary search algorithm would start by comparing the target number with the middle element of the array. If it's not a match, it ignores one half of the array and continues the same process with the remaining half. This halving continues until the element is found or the subset becomes empty. In each step, the problem size is reduced by half, which leads to a O(log(N)) time complexity.

Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) Lookup: Similar to binary search, every time you traverse from a node to one of its children in a balanced BST, you are essentially halving the path to the particular node you are looking for.

Visualizing Logarithmic Growth:
To visualize logarithmic growth, you can think of it as the number of times you can divide N by 2 before getting to 1:

N = 16

16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 (Logarithmic steps: 4)
If you plot the function y = log_b(N), you'll notice it increases to infinity as N goes to infinity, but it does so very gradually compared to a linear growth which is represented as a straight line or quadratic growth that forms a parabola with a steep increase.

Mathematical Properties:
Some properties of logarithms relevant to time complexity analysis include:

log_b(M * N) = log_b(M) + log_b(N)
log_b(M/N) = log_b(M) - log_b(N)
log_b(M^k) = k * log_b(M)
If the base of the logarithm isn't specified, it's often assumed to be 2 for computational complexity analysis since algorithms often involve dividing data into halves (binary operations).
In computational complexity, constants and less significant terms are usually ignored because they don't affect the growth rate as N becomes very large. Thus O(log_2(N)), O(log_10(N)), and O(log_e(N)) are all considered equivalent and are simplified to O(log(N)) in Big O notation. The base of the logarithm is less important in the context of Big O notation since logarithms of different bases are only different by a constant factor, and Big O notation ignores constants.

```go
func binarySearch(arr []int, target int) int {
    lo, hi := 0, len(arr)-1
    for lo <= hi {
        mid := lo + (hi-lo)/2
        if arr[mid] == target {
            return mid
        } else if arr[mid] < target {
            lo = mid + 1
        } else {
            hi = mid - 1
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```
‚úÖ Each step halves the array ‚Üí **O(log n)**.

#### **Example 4: Exponential Complexity (O(2‚Åø))**
```go
func fibonacci(n int) int {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n
    }
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
}
```
‚úÖ Each call branches into two ‚Üí **O(2‚Åø)**.

## **4. Understanding Space Complexity**
### **Rules of Thumb**
1. **Primitive variables** (int, float, bool) ‚Üí **O(1)**.
2. **Arrays/Slices** of size \( n \) ‚Üí **O(n)**.
3. **Recursive calls** ‚Üí Depth of recursion determines space.

### **Examples**
#### **Example 1: Constant Space (O(1))**
```go
func sum(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```
‚úÖ Uses fixed memory ‚Üí **O(1)**.

#### **Example 2: Linear Space (O(n))**
```go
func createArray(n int) []int {
    arr := make([]int, n)
    return arr
}
```
‚úÖ Allocates an array of size \( n \) ‚Üí **O(n)**.

## **5. Choosing the Best Algorithm for a Problem**
### **Step 1: Identify Constraints**
| Input Size (n) | Acceptable Complexity |
|--------------|---------------------|
| \( n \leq 100 \) | O(n¬≤) is acceptable |
| \( n \leq 10^6 \) | O(n log n) is required |
| \( n > 10^6 \) | O(n) or better needed |

### **Step 2: Match the Problem Type**
| Problem | Best Approach | Complexity |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Searching  | Binary search | O(log n) |
| Sorting    | Quick/Merge sort | O(n log n) |
| Pathfinding | Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm | O(V + E log V) |
| Recursion  | Dynamic programming | O(n) |

## **6. Interview Strategy: How to Evaluate Complexity in Problems**
### **1. Ask Clarifying Questions**
- "What is the maximum input size?"
- "Should we optimize for time or space?"

### **2. Identify the Core Operation**
- **Single loop?** ‚Üí **O(n)**
- **Nested loops?** ‚Üí **O(n¬≤)**
- **Halving the input?** ‚Üí **O(log n)**
- **Recursive calls?** ‚Üí **Depends on recurrence relation**

### **3. Explain Your Thought Process**
- "Since we iterate through the array once, the complexity is O(n)."
- "Each level of recursion reduces input size by half, so it‚Äôs O(log n)."

## **7. Example Interview Problem: Finding Duplicates**
### **Question:** Given an array of integers, return all duplicates.

### **Brute Force Solution (O(n¬≤))**
```go
func findDuplicatesBrute(arr []int) []int {
    n := len(arr)
    var result []int
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < n; j++ {
            if arr[i] == arr[j] {
                result = append(result, arr[i])
            }
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

### **Optimized Solution Using Hash Map (O(n))**
```go
func findDuplicates(arr []int) []int {
    seen := make(map[int]bool)
    var result []int
    for _, num := range arr {
        if seen[num] {
            result = append(result, num)
        }
        seen[num] = true
    }
    return result
}
```

### **Comparison**
| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Brute force | O(n¬≤) | O(1) |
| Hash map | O(n) | O(n) |
