# Coding Interview Mastery Protocol

**Structured Guide for Solving Medium, Hard, and Super Hard Problems**

---

## ðŸš€ Mental Preparation (2 min)

- Perform deep breathing exercises (4-7-8 breathing method).
- Visualize yourself calmly solving the problem step-by-step.

## Step 1: Clearly Define the Problem (2-5 min)

- Restate the problem clearly in your own words.
- Identify key constraints:
   - Input/output size and format
   - Edge cases (empty input, duplicates, limits)
- Visualize examples to internalize the problem.

## Step 2: Recognize Patterns & Strategize (5-10 min)

- Classify the problem using known patterns:
   - Binary Search, Two Pointers, Sliding Window
   - DFS/BFS, Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms
- Determine the optimal algorithm/data structure to apply.

## Step 3: Plan & Outline Clearly (5-10 min)

- Break the problem into small, logical steps:
   1. Define algorithmic steps clearly.
   2. Choose appropriate data structures.
   3. Sketch pseudocode or structured comments.
- Predict time and space complexity.

## Step 4: Implement Incrementally (10-25 min)

- Write modular, readable, and maintainable code.
- Test each sub-component individually before integrating:
   - Check correctness on simple inputs first.
   - Gradually build complexity.
- Continuously debug and validate assumptions.

## Step 5: Debug Systematically (if stuck after 45 min)

- Pause and perform structured reflection:
   - Which step or logic is unclear?
   - Have you seen similar solutions?
- Seek minimal assistance (a small hint or high-level explanation) if necessary.
- Implement immediately after a hint to reinforce learning.

## Step 6: Actively Learn from Solutions (10-15 min)

- Don't passively read solutions. Engage deeply:
   - Write key insights and unique problem traits.
   - Break down the official solution into understandable steps.
   - Reimplement from memory, then compare.

## Step 6: **Reinforce** & Consolidate (Immediately)

- Solve a similar or slightly modified problem:
   - Change constraints or inputs.
   - Ensure you can apply the same logic without assistance.

## Step 7: Weekly Review & Anki Integration

- Track recurring challenges or weak patterns (Binary Search, DP, etc.).
- Weekly revisit challenging problems and re-solve independently.
- Use Anki flashcards to strengthen recall of key concepts and patterns.

## Neuroscience-Backed Techniques for Optimal Performance

- Before Interview:
   - 4-7-8 Breathing (reduce anxiety)
   - Visualization of successful problem-solving
- During Practice:
   - Deliberate practice (focus on specific weaknesses)
   - Short, intensive, daily sessions (2 hours)
- After Practice:
   - Reflective journaling (identify improvements, insights, areas for growth)
   - Active recall using Anki

## ðŸ”‘ Mindset Principles for Success

- Embrace struggles as learning opportunities.
- Treat failure as insight, not defeat.
- Commit to consistency and systematic growth over instant solutions.

Following this structured, neuroscience-informed protocol consistently will build strong problem-solving reflexes and ensure peak performance in FAANG+ coding interviews.
