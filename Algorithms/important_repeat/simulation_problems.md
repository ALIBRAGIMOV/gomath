## üéØ **Step 1: Clearly Understand (5-8 min)**

### **Behavior Simulation:**
- **Communication:** Clearly verbalize your thought process as if explaining to an interviewer.
- **Confidence:** Maintain a calm demeanor, visualizing yourself confidently managing the interview setting.

### **Problem Comprehension:**
- **Read Slowly & Carefully:** Read the problem at least twice.
- **Summarize Explicitly:**
   - **Restate:** Explain the problem clearly in your own words.
   - **Clarify Requirements:**
      - **Inputs:** Type, size, range, and format.
      - **Outputs:** Clearly defined expected format.
      - **Constraints:** Time complexity, memory limits, data limits.
      - **Edge Cases:** Note special scenarios explicitly.

## üó∫Ô∏è **Step 2: Create a Solid Plan (8-12 min)**

### **Behavior Simulation:**
- **Structured Thinking:** Verbally outline your logic, showing clear thought organization.
- **Active Clarification:** Simulate asking clarifying questions as you would in an interview.

### **Detailed Solution Planning:**
- **State Management:**
   - Clearly define and justify state variables.
   - Select optimal data structures explicitly (structs, slices, maps).
- **Algorithmic Breakdown:**
   - Write structured pseudocode.
   - Identify explicit loops, conditions, and state updates.
- **Identify Potential Pitfalls:**
   - Clearly anticipate and highlight potential difficulties or complex logic.

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Step 3: Implement Clean Go Code (15-25 min)**

### **Behavior Simulation:**
- **Clarity and Calmness:** Write code methodically, explaining each step as you go.
- **Confidence:** Handle coding calmly, displaying clear logic and structure.

### **High-Quality Implementation:**
- **Code Organization:**
   - Modular, reusable, and clearly separated functions.
   - Single responsibility for each function.
- **Idiomatic Go (Uber Go Style Guide):**
   - Use meaningful naming conventions consistently.
   - Explicitly handle errors and edge cases.
   - Avoid deep nesting; favor early returns for readability.
- **Explicit State Handling:**
   - Clearly manage and update every state explicitly.
   - Immediately handle special edge cases clearly in your implementation.
- **Documentation:**
   - Clearly comment and justify non-obvious logic.

## üß™ **Step 4: Intelligent Testing & Debugging (8-12 min)**

### **Behavior Simulation:**
- **Systematic Problem-Solving:** Demonstrate calm, methodical debugging and logical thinking.
- **Communication:** Clearly verbalize each testing step and its purpose.

### **Structured Testing Approach:**
- **Run Initial Examples:** Carefully verify provided test cases first.
- **Create Edge Tests:** Explicitly test edge cases, boundary conditions, and maximum/minimum constraints.
- **Logical Debugging:**
   - Insert targeted debug statements logically.
   - Systematically isolate and solve issues rather than guessing.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Step 5: Optimization & Reflection (5-10 min)**

### **Behavior Simulation:**
- **Analytical Mindset:** Clearly articulate your optimization strategies.
- **Reflective Growth:** Communicate what you've learned and how you'll apply it next time.

### **Structured Optimization and Reflection:**
- **Optimization Review:**
   - Explicitly reassess your solution‚Äôs time and space complexity.
   - Clearly identify performance bottlenecks.
   - Simplify and improve code structure.
- **Reflective Documentation:**
   - Summarize explicitly:
      - Successful strategies used.
      - Challenges faced and how they were overcome.
      - Key insights and improvement strategies for future scenarios.

## üèÜ **Progression Goals by Problem Level**

### **Easy Level:**
- Target: 10-15 min
- Focus: Clearly grasp fundamentals, rapid coding.

### **Medium Level:**
- Target: 15-20 min
- Focus: Clear planning, robust implementation, initial optimizations.

### **Hard Level:**
- Target: 20-25 min
- Focus: Deeper analysis, efficient coding, strategic optimizations.

### **Very Hard Level (Target after 3 months):**
- Target: 20-30 min
- Mastery: Efficient and confident problem-solving, swift and clear code implementation, expert optimization and debugging skills.

## üß† **Daily Neuroscience-Based Preparation**
- **Before practice:**
   - Deep breathing (4-7-8) to reduce stress.
   - Visualization exercises to enhance focus and performance.
- **During practice:**
   - Maintain regular short breaks (Pomodoro: 25 min work / 5 min rest).
- **After practice:**
   - Reflective journaling to reinforce learning and insights.

## üí° **Consistent Simulation = Interview Mastery**
Practice deliberately daily, simulate realistic interview scenarios, and progressively challenge yourself. Consistency and strategic reflection are keys to achieving exceptional performance in real interviews.
