## Step-by-Step Guide to Solving Problems Efficiently

### Step 1: Understand the Problem (5-10 min)
1. **Read the problem statement carefully** to grasp the requirements.
2. **Identify input and output formats** and constraints.
3. **Clarify any ambiguities** (in a real interview, ask the interviewer).
4. **Identify edge cases** that might break naive solutions.

### Step 2: Plan the Approach (10-15 min)
1. **Determine brute-force solution** (even if inefficient, it helps frame the problem).
2. **Analyze time and space complexity** to check feasibility.
3. **Consider data structures** (arrays, hashmaps, trees, heaps, graphs, etc.).
4. **Optimize incrementally** (binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, etc.).

### Step 3: Implement the Solution (15-30 min)
1. **Write clean and structured code** (meaningful variable names, modular design).
2. **Use helper functions if needed** to improve readability.
3. **Follow best practices** (early exits, handling nil values in Go, etc.).

### Step 4: Test and Debug (10-20 min)
1. **Test with sample inputs** and verify outputs.
2. **Test edge cases and large inputs** for performance.
3. **Use debugging tools/logging** if necessary.

### Step 5: Analyze and Optimize (5-15 min)
1. **Compare with ideal solution** and optimize if needed.
2. **Analyze alternative approaches** (e.g., using different data structures).
3. **Refactor for readability and efficiency**.

## Daily Schedule for Solving LeetCode Problems with a Full-Time Job

### Goal: Solve 3 problems daily (Easy, Medium, Hard)

### Weekday Plan (Total ~2 Hours per Day)

#### Morning (Before Work, ~30 min)
- **Review yesterdayâ€™s hard problem** (even if you solved it, reflect on optimizations).
- **Solve an Easy problem** to build confidence and recall patterns.

#### Lunch Break (~40 min)
- **Solve a Medium problem** (focus on implementing optimized solutions).
- **Write notes about key takeaways**.

#### Evening (After Work, ~50 min)
- **Solve a Hard problem or revisit past mistakes**.
- **Analyze solutions and reflect on patterns**.
- **Discuss solutions on forums like LeetCode, Codeforces, or GitHub**.

### Weekend Plan (~3-4 hours per day)
- **Mock interviews** (self-timed or with a peer).
- **Deep dive into weak areas** (e.g., dynamic programming, graphs).
- **Watch algorithm tutorials** (NeetCode, Errichto, William Fiset, MIT OpenCourseWare).
- **Review previously solved problems** and apply new insights.

## Growth Strategy to Master LeetCode

### 1. **Progressive Difficulty Approach**
- Start with **Easy problems** (~50 total) to master fundamentals.
- Move to **Medium problems** (~100 total) for deeper problem-solving.
- Tackle **Hard problems** (~50 total) to develop elite skills.

### 2. **Pattern-Based Learning**
- Recognize recurring patterns in problems (e.g., two-pointer technique, backtracking, dynamic programming memoization).
- Maintain a **cheat sheet** with common patterns.

### 3. **Time-Boxed Learning for Efficiency**
- Limit each problem-solving session to **45-60 minutes**.
- Spend **at most 20 min debugging**; otherwise, review the optimal solution.

### 4. **Spaced Repetition & Active Recall**
- **Revisit past problems** every week to reinforce learning.
- Use **flashcards for algorithms** and time complexities.
- Teach concepts to others (or pretend to explain to a colleague).

### 5. **Mock Interviews & Real-World Application**
- Schedule **weekly mock interviews** to simulate pressure.
- Implement **LeetCode solutions in real projects** for deeper understanding.
