# Elite-Level Coding Interview Study Plan â€“ Week 3: DFS on Trees

## Objective:
Master **DFS on Trees** to rapidly solve related coding interview problems efficiently (within 20-30 mins).

---

## Daily Training Schedule (2-3 hours)

### 1. Daily Warm-Up (20 mins)
- **Active Recall & Flashcards:**
  - DFS tree traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder
  - Common use-cases: tree height, diameter, path sums, subtree queries, lowest common ancestor (LCA)

### 2. Theoretical Mastery & Conceptual Understanding (30 mins)
- Study and clearly summarize concepts:
  - DFS traversal strategies (recursive & iterative approaches)
  - Identifying tree problems suitable for DFS
  - Patterns (tree path problems, lowest common ancestor, subtree matching)

### 2. Timed Problem-Solving (60-90 mins)
| Day       | Problems (LeetCode)                                                                                 | Difficulty |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Monday    | [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)       | Easy       |
|           | [Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)     | Easy       |
| Tuesday   | [Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)         | Hard       |
| Wednesday | [Lowest Common Ancestor of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/) | Medium     |
| Thursday  | [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)                   | Medium     |
| Friday    | [Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/) | Hard       |
| Saturday  | [Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/)   | Medium     |
| Sunday    | Review & Re-attempt all problems                                                                    | Mixed      |

- Strict timer per problem (initially 45 mins, reduce gradually to 20-30 mins).
- Immediately after each problem, clearly explain the solution aloud or in written form.

### 3. Daily Conceptual Mastery (30 mins)
- Deep-dive theory (DFS variations, recursion strategies, and tree-specific edge cases).
- Write concise summaries and visualization (diagrams) for each algorithm.

### 3. Mock Interviews (Weekly, 60 mins)
- Simulate real interview scenarios:
  - Solve 1-2 challenging DFS/tree problems.
  - Clearly verbalize your thought process.
- Post-session feedback and reflection to target weaknesses.

---

## Weekly Reflection (Sunday)
- Review notes and solved problems for DFS.
- Identify repeated mistakes or misunderstandings.
- Make a clear action plan to address gaps for the following week.

---

## Neuroscience & Learning Strategies Integrated
- **Active Recall:** Frequently revisit solutions without hints.
- **Spaced Repetition:** Regularly review key solutions at intervals (1, 3, 7 days).
- **Interleaving:** Practice problems from multiple categories to strengthen adaptability.
- **Time Pressure Training:** Consistently solve problems under timed conditions to mimic interview scenarios.

Follow this disciplined plan, and your ability to rapidly and confidently solve DFS problems on trees will significantly improve, setting you up for success in FAANG+ coding interviews.
