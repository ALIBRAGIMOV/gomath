# **Daily Structured Study Plan â€“ Week 2: Two Pointers**

### Objective
Enhance your efficiency, accuracy, and speed in solving **Two-Pointer** problems for coding interviews at FAANG+ level.

---

## **Daily Time Breakdown (2-3 hours)**

### **1. Warm-Up & Active Recall (20 mins)**
- **Flashcards & Quick Review:**
    - Review Two-Pointer concepts (Sliding Window, Slow-Fast Pointer, Opposite-Direction Pointers).
    - Active recall of solved problems and their approaches from memory.

### **2. Theory & Concept (30 mins)**
- Study Two-Pointer patterns:
    - Opposite directional pointers
    - Fast-slow pointers (Cycle detection, Linked List operations)
    - Sliding Window technique
    - Pair-sum and related problems
- Take concise notes summarizing each pattern.

### **3. Timed Problem-Solving Session (60-90 mins)**
| Day       | Problems (LeetCode)                                                          | Difficulty |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Monday    | [Two Sum II - Input Array is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/) <br> [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)                              | Easy       |
| Tuesday   | [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) | Medium     |
| Wednesday | [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)                                  | Medium     |
| Thursday  | [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)    | Hard       |
| Friday    | [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) | Medium     |
| Saturday  | [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/) | Hard       |
| sunday    | [get-the-maximum-score](https://leetcode.com/problems/get-the-maximum-score/description/) | Hard       |
| Sunday    | Review all solved problems without hints                                     | Mixed      |

- Use **Pomodoro** timer: strict 30-min limit per problem. Initially, allow up to 45 mins for harder problems and reduce with improvement.
- Write clear explanations post-solving to reinforce learning.

### **4. Code Review & Optimization (15 mins)**
- Compare your solution against optimal/top-voted solutions.
- Identify areas of improvement (speed, readability, efficiency).

---

## **Weekly Mock Interview Session (60 mins)**
- Simulate a realistic interview scenario (timed, webcam on, verbalize thoughts clearly).
- Ask a peer or use a platform (Pramp, Interviewing.io) to simulate interview conditions.
- Get structured feedback to identify key improvements.

---

## **Weekly Reflection (Sunday)**
- Identify recurring mistakes or slower patterns.
- Adjust your approach to target these weaknesses next week.
- Write a brief summary of key learnings and solutions for reinforcement.

---

## **Best-Practice Neuroscience Techniques Used:**
- **Spaced Repetition** (daily & weekly recall sessions).
- **Active Recall:** Flashcards, summarizing, explaining out loud.
- **Interleaved Practice:** Solving diverse two-pointer problems to enhance adaptive problem-solving.
- **Time Pressure Simulation:** Improving speed and accuracy under realistic interview constraints.

Following this structured routine consistently will rapidly advance your proficiency and confidence in solving complex two-pointer problems efficiently, preparing you optimally for FAANG+ interviews.
