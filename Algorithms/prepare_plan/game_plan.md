# Elite-Level Coding Interview Study Plan for FAANG+

## Objective
Develop the skill to confidently solve **very hard** coding problems in **20–30 minutes** for FAANG+ interviews. This structured plan integrates neuroscience-backed learning techniques with expert interview strategies to maximize efficiency and mastery.

## Daily Schedule (2–3 hours)

### Morning Routine (60–90 mins)
1. **Pattern Recognition Drills (15 mins)**
    - Quickly skim 5–10 random LeetCode problems.
    - Identify algorithms or patterns (DP, binary search, graphs, etc.).

2. **Timed Problem Solving (30 mins)**
    - Solve one Medium/Hard-level LeetCode problem.
    - Strictly enforce the 20–30 min time limit.

3. **Deep Algorithm Mastery (30–60 mins)**
    - Focus deeply on one algorithmic topic per week:
        - Week 1: **Graph Algorithms** (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, topological sort, DP on trees)
        - Week 2: **Dynamic Programming (classic DP, tree DP, bitmask DP)**
        - Week 3: **Advanced Data Structures (segment trees, Fenwick trees, tries, heaps)**
        - Week 4: **Mixed Advanced Topics (bit manipulation, number theory, complex graph problems)**

    - Each topic involves:
        - Understanding theory from authoritative sources.
        - Writing clean, optimized implementations from scratch.
        - Practicing multiple relevant problems to build familiarity.

3. **Meta-Learning and Solution Analysis (30 mins)**
    - Review and analyze top solutions from the LeetCode Discuss forum.
    - Write clear explanations of your solutions to reinforce understanding and memory.

## Neuroscience-Based Techniques
### Spaced Repetition & Active Recall (Daily, 20 mins)
- Regularly review solved problems and algorithms using spaced intervals:
    - Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14, etc.
- Actively recall solutions verbally or by rewriting code from memory.
- Use tools like flashcards or Anki for systematic review.

### Multi-Sensory Learning (Integrated Daily)
- Speak solutions aloud to yourself or a peer.
- Write summaries or visual mind maps.
- Teach/explain problems to imaginary or real peers.

## FAANG+ Interview Simulation (Weekly, 60 mins)
- Conduct weekly mock interviews:
    - Simulate realistic interview conditions (time pressure, thinking aloud, whiteboard-style coding).
    - Receive detailed feedback on clarity, correctness, efficiency, and communication.
    - Analyze performance to identify recurring weaknesses and improve systematically.

## Meta Problem-Solving Methodology
Adopt a structured, systematic framework for problem-solving:
1. **Clarify the Problem:** Restate in your own words, ask clarifying questions.
2. **Analyze Constraints and Identify Patterns:** Quickly determine likely algorithmic approach based on input size and problem description.
3. **Outline a Plan:** Start with brute force, then incrementally optimize.
4. **Implement Carefully:** Clean, concise, and clear code. Address edge cases upfront.
5. **Test and Debug:** Rapidly debug issues systematically with clear test cases.

## Weekly Study Schedule
| Day | Activity                                                                 |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mon  | Graph algorithms (theory + practice)                                 |
| Tue  | Dynamic Programming (timed practice + deep dive)                      |
| Wed  | Advanced Data Structures (timed practice + review sessions)           |
| Thu  | Mixed Review Day (interleaved practice problems from previous weeks)  |
| Fri  | Mock Interview (realistic simulation, feedback analysis)              |
| Sat  | Spaced repetition and active recall session (review previously solved problems) |
| Sun  | Rest and Reflect (mental recovery, light reflection on learnings)     |

## Daily Schedule Example (2-3 hrs/day)
- **30 min:** Warm-up (spaced repetition + recall flashcards).
- **60-90 min:** Deep-dive into algorithm/topic with timed problems.
- **30 min:** Problem-solving sprint (20–30 min hard-level LeetCode).
- **10 min:** Reflect on the day's learning, note areas to improve.

## Continuous Improvement
- Regularly assess your performance after each mock and timed session.
- Use mistakes as focused improvement opportunities.
- Adjust study intensity for weaker topics as identified through mock interview feedback.

## Final Recommendations
- Maintain consistency (2–3 hours daily is ideal).
- Prioritize understanding and recall over quantity.
- Regular breaks, sleep, and mental rest are critical for effective learning and memory consolidation.

Follow this neuroscience-backed and methodically structured approach consistently, and you will dramatically accelerate your ability to solve hard problems efficiently, confidently acing your FAANG+ interviews.
