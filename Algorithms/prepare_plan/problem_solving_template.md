### **Easy Problem (20 min)**

- **Objective**: Quickly understand and solve a relatively simple problem using basic algorithms or data structures.

- **Time Allocation**:
    - **00:00 - 02:00 → Problem Understanding**:  
      Read the problem carefully. Identify input-output requirements and constraints. Understand the core task.

    - **02:00 - 04:00 → Plan Approach**:  
      Identify the simplest algorithm or data structure to solve the problem. Consider basic methods like loops or simple recursion.

    - **04:00 - 06:00 → Edge Case Identification**:  
      Think of edge cases like empty arrays, extreme values, or special conditions that could break the logic.

    - **06:00 - 12:00 → Coding**:  
      Write the code implementation for the solution. Focus on clarity and simplicity.

    - **12:00 - 16:00 → Time Complexity Analysis**:  
      Ensure the solution runs in optimal time (usually O(n) or O(log n) for easy problems).

    - **16:00 - 20:00 → Test & Refine**:  
      Test the solution with different inputs. Refine the code if necessary to handle edge cases.

### **Medium Problem (30 min)**

- **Objective**: Solve a moderately complex problem requiring algorithmic thinking and efficient implementation.

- **Time Allocation**:
    - **00:00 - 03:00 → Problem Understanding**:  
      Read the problem statement in detail. Identify key challenges, constraints, and requirements. Understand the expected time complexity.

    - **03:00 - 05:00 → Plan Approach**:  
      Brainstorm possible strategies (e.g., binary search, dynamic programming, sliding window). Choose the most efficient approach.

    - **05:00 - 07:00 → Edge Case Identification**:  
      Think through potential edge cases like small arrays, negative values, or large inputs.

    - **07:00 - 15:00 → Coding**:  
      Write the code based on the chosen approach. Focus on clear and structured logic with minimal duplication.

    - **15:00 - 20:00 → Time Complexity Analysis**:  
      Ensure the solution meets the expected time complexity (usually O(n log n), O(n), or O(log n) for medium problems).

    - **20:00 - 25:00 → Test & Debug**:  
      Test the solution with various inputs. If any issues arise, debug the code and optimize if necessary.

    - **25:00 - 30:00 → Final Refinements**:  
      Refine the solution for efficiency. Ensure that edge cases and performance are both handled well.

### **Hard Problem (45 min)**

- **Objective**: Solve a complex problem requiring advanced algorithms, deep understanding of data structures, or optimization techniques.

- **Time Allocation**:
    - **00:00 - 05:00 → Problem Understanding**:  
      Carefully read and break down the problem. Focus on identifying the most complex aspects and constraints that could impact the solution.

    - **05:00 - 10:00 → Plan Approach**:  
      Design an algorithm that efficiently solves the problem. Consider advanced techniques like divide and conquer, dynamic programming, or graph traversal.

    - **10:00 - 15:00 → Edge Case Identification**:  
      Identify all edge cases, including large inputs, boundary values, or non-trivial scenarios. Think through how the algorithm should handle them.

    - **15:00 - 30:00 → Coding**:  
      Implement the solution based on the planned approach. Write modular code and use comments to explain key parts of the algorithm.

    - **30:00 - 35:00 → Time Complexity & Optimization**:  
      Analyze the solution’s time complexity. Ensure the solution is as efficient as possible. Consider ways to optimize both time and space complexity.

    - **35:00 - 40:00 → Test & Debug**:  
      Test the solution on multiple test cases, especially edge cases. Debug if any issues arise and optimize if necessary.

    - **40:00 - 45:00 → Final Refinements**:  
      Clean up the code, ensure readability, and refactor any inefficient sections. Recheck edge cases and confirm that the solution is robust and optimal.

### **General Best Practices for Each Problem Level**

- **Time Management**: Stick to the time allocation. Don’t spend more than the designated time on any particular step. This is key for interviews.
- **Code Readability**: Write clean and readable code. Use proper variable names, indentation, and comments to explain your thought process.
- **Optimization**: For medium and hard problems, always try to optimize your solution after the initial implementation. Aim for better time and space complexity.
- **Edge Case Testing**: Always consider edge cases, especially for medium and hard problems. These often trip up many solutions.
- **Debugging**: If you run into issues, debug systematically. Start with print statements, and identify where the logic or flow is incorrect.
