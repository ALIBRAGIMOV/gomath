# Problem-Solving Layout Template — Cheat Sheet

Use this guide to structure your approach for coding interviews and daily practice. It’s designed to help you **understand problems, plan solutions, and optimize your workflow** at different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). Adhering to these steps will keep you organized, highlight edge cases, and ensure you produce clean, optimized code.

## **Easy Problem (Approx. 20 minutes)**

- **Objective**  
  Solve a straightforward problem using basic algorithms and data structures.

- **Suggested Time Allocation**
    1. **(0–2 min) Problem Understanding**
        - Read the problem statement carefully.
        - Identify input and output formats.
        - Pinpoint any specific constraints.

    2. **(2–4 min) Plan Approach**
        - Decide on the simplest algorithm or data structure.
        - Consider if a basic loop or straightforward recursion suffices.

    3. **(4–6 min) Identify Edge Cases**
        - Check for empty arrays, single-element inputs, extreme integer values, etc.

    4. **(6–12 min) Coding**
        - Implement a clear, concise solution.
        - Focus on readability rather than premature optimization.

    5. **(12–16 min) Time Complexity Analysis**
        - Verify the solution meets expected performance (often O(n) or O(log n)).
        - Confirm no unnecessary bottlenecks.

    6. **(16–20 min) Test & Refine**
        - Run tests on typical and edge cases.
        - Refactor if needed for clarity or performance.

## **Medium Problem (Approx. 30 minutes)**

- **Objective**  
  Solve a moderately complex problem requiring **more sophisticated algorithms** or **efficient data structures**.

- **Suggested Time Allocation**
    1. **(0–3 min) Problem Understanding**
        - Thoroughly read and restate the problem in your own words.
        - Identify **key challenges** and constraints.

    2. **(3–5 min) Plan Approach**
        - Brainstorm multiple strategies (e.g., binary search, hashing, simple dynamic programming).
        - Choose the best trade-off between simplicity and performance.

    3. **(5–7 min) Identify Edge Cases**
        - Consider boundary conditions like very large or very small inputs, invalid data, etc.

    4. **(7–15 min) Coding**
        - Implement the chosen solution with **structured, clean logic**.
        - Favor clarity and maintainability over clever but opaque code.

    5. **(15–20 min) Time Complexity Analysis**
        - Ensure the solution aligns with acceptable complexity (often O(n log n), O(n), or O(log n)).
        - Reevaluate if the approach seems too slow.

    6. **(20–25 min) Test & Debug**
        - Use targeted test cases to uncover logical errors.
        - Debug systematically, using print statements or a debugger if necessary.

    7. **(25–30 min) Final Refinements**
        - Optimize any suboptimal parts (e.g., reduce redundant operations).
        - Double-check for edge-case coverage.

## **Hard Problem (Approx. 45 minutes)**

- **Objective**  
  Tackle a **complex** or **highly optimized** problem using advanced algorithms or detailed data structures (e.g., graph algorithms, segment trees, advanced dynamic programming).

- **Suggested Time Allocation**
    1. **(0–5 min) Problem Understanding**
        - Carefully dissect the problem statement.
        - Clarify tricky constraints and performance expectations.

    2. **(5–10 min) Plan Approach**
        - Sketch out a roadmap of **advanced techniques** (divide and conquer, dynamic programming, graph traversal, etc.).
        - Select an approach that balances theoretical complexity with practical implementation feasibility.

    3. **(10–15 min) Identify Edge Cases**
        - Thoroughly list edge cases: large N, special configurations, non-trivial data distributions.
        - Decide how the algorithm handles each scenario.

    4. **(15–30 min) Coding**
        - Implement the solution in **modular, well-documented** code.
        - Use helper functions or well-labeled code blocks for clarity.

    5. **(30–35 min) Time Complexity & Optimization**
        - Analyze the algorithm’s time and space complexities.
        - Seek further optimizations if you detect bottlenecks or high memory usage.

    6. **(35–40 min) Test & Debug**
        - Test across diverse inputs (small, large, edge-patterned).
        - Debug issues with a structured approach, focusing on tricky parts of the logic.

    7. **(40–45 min) Final Refinements**
        - Polish the code for readability and maintainability.
        - Confirm all edge cases are covered.
        - Reassess complexity and ensure it meets the problem constraints.

## **General Best Practices**

1. **Time Management**
    - Stick to the allocated time segments.
    - Practice a steady workflow: understand, plan, code, analyze, test.

2. **Clear Communication**
    - During interviews, **verbalize** your thought process and trade-offs.
    - Explain how you arrived at each decision.

3. **Code Readability**
    - Use expressive variable names and consistent formatting.
    - Keep functions small and focused on a single task.

4. **Optimization After Correctness**
    - First, ensure your solution **works correctly**.
    - Then, analyze performance and optimize as needed.

5. **Systematic Testing**
    - Always test your code with **normal**, **edge**, and **extreme** cases.
    - Confirm you handle all specified constraints effectively.

6. **Daily Practice & Continuous Learning**
    - Regularly **simulate interview conditions** (timed problem-solving).
    - Explore **new algorithms** and **data structures**.
    - Reflect on mistakes and refine your approach to build deeper expertise.
